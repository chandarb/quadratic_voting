# quadratic_voting

Numerical Simulation of Quadratic Voting 

simulation.R: Code to execute the simulation for inputted parameters.

auxilliary.R: Auxilliary functions. Root solver, utility function and first order condition for QV, utility to vote interpolator.

initialize.R: Initialize the simulation for the inputted utility distribution and parameters.

welf_calc.R: Compute welfare after a stable point is found.

dc_funcs.R: Functions relevant to cases when there's a discontinuity in the voting function.

no_dc.R: Functions relevant to cases when there's no discontinuity in the voting function.
