# quadratic_voting

Numerical Simulation of Quadratic Voting 

run_simulation.R: Take in the inputed parameters and run the simulation.

simulation.R: Code for the simulation.

auxilliary.R: Auxilliary functions. Root solver, utility function and first order condition for QV, utility to vote interpolator.

initialize.R: Initialize the simulation for the inputted utility distribution and parameters.

welf_calc.R: Compute welfare after a stable point is found.

dc_funcs.R: Functions relevant to cases when there's a discontinuity in the voting function.

no_dc.R: Functions relevant to cases when there's no discontinuity in the voting function.

QV_input.json: JSON file that can be used to input the parameter settings.
